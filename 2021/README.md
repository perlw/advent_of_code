A note on the contents of this directory.

I'm using this year's Advent of Code to learn more about zig. As such there's a definite ebb and flow
in the quality and idiomaticness of the code written as I explored and tried out different things.
It is by no means an example of production ready zig code, or good code in general. It simply represents
my road to learning the language, the good, the bad, and the ugly, and should not be used as an example
in any way (except maybe on what _not_ to do).

Cheers.
